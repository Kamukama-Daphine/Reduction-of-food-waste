# Reduction-of-food-waste
Donating food helps protect our environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and it keeps healthy food where it belongs: in pantries and on plates, not in landfill.
#Top 5 ways to cut down on food waste
Don't over buy. Keep track of what you've bought and used. As savor we suggest taking a 'shelfie' â€“ a photo of your fridge and cupboards to remind you of what's there.
Check the use-by dates of fresh food when you buy it. These are the dates to take notice of, rather than the best-before dates. Only buy what you can use before it expires.
Plan ahead. Think about what you're going to cook and how you'll use the leftovers.
Get to know your grocer. They will have plenty of advice on how to use up leftover veg.
Love your freezer. Use your weekends to batch-cook and freeze. There are plenty of freezing tips in our [guide](www.savor.com).
